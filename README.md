# Data-Analysis
This repository contains my data analysis scripts, which were written in accordance with the statistical methods detailed in the Clinical &amp; Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. 

The precision analysis script processes data for studies that adhere to the classic 20 x 2 x 2 experimental design. It employs an ANOVA-based methodology to evaluate both the repeatability and within-laboratory precision of a quantitative measurement procedure, providing insights within a 95% confidence interval.
