# Data-Analysis
The precision analysis script processes data from the classic 20 x 2 x 2 study design and uses ANOVA to estimate repeatability and within‑laboratory precision at the 95% confidence level.

Method note: This implementation reproduces the appendix worked example from CLSI EP05 in base R to validate understanding. Package alternatives exist, but the goal here was to derive and verify the calculations directly rather than rely on a library.
